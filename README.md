# Wild Jungle Escape

The purpose for this project was to create a Mario-style game, where the player starts on the far left side of the screen. The player needs to jump over obstacles and avoid enemies while moving toward the right side of the screen. The player only gets one chance, if he is touched by an enemy he dies and the game prompts a reset. If player survives for a pre-determined amount of time they win the game and get a trophy. I had to change the dynamic of the game and make it into a scroll game instead. The character now remains in place while the background moves behind him. The way you win the game is by lasting as long as possible without hitting any of the obstacles or creatures always trying to beat your previous high-score.


This is what my wire frame was before starting the project.

These were the things I wanted my game to have as a developer:

- I want to have clear instructions for the game.
- I want it to look aesthetically pleasing
- As a user, I want to clearly know if I won or lost.
- Once the game is over I want there to be an easy way for the user to restart the game and play as many times as they want


MVP Goals

- Ability to be able to move the character using the arrow keys
- Ability to jump over obstacles
- Ability to start the game
- Ability to reset the game
- Ability to display the character and enemies
- Background to tie the whole thing together


In future I would love to be able to upgrade the player at some point with some kind of power up. I would also like for the enemies to begin moving faster towards the player after a set amount of time to make it more challenging. I would also like a way to eliminate the creatures and earn more points instead of just avoiding them.
